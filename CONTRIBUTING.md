# Contribution guidelines

We really like contributions and bug reports, in fact the project wouldn't have got to this stage without them. 
We do have a few guidelines to bear in mind.

## Raising bugs

When raising bugs please explain the issue in good detail and provide a guide to how to replicate it. 
When describing the bug it's useful to follow the format:

- what you did
- what you expected to happen
- what happened

## Suggesting features

Please raise feature requests as issues before contributing any code.
This is just to ensure they are discussed properly before any time is spent on them.

## Contributing code

### Indentation and whitespace

2-space, soft-tabs only please. No trailing whitespace.
